# ECE351 Homework 8

Design, simulate, and synthesize a 5-bit barrel shifter.
Make sure modules are flexible with parameters.

A provided top module has been modified to wire the new 
modules made for this assignment.

Barrel Shifter files:
- hw8_fpga.v       ==> modified top module for barrel shifter
- barrel_shifter.v ==> module for barrel shifting
- double_dabble.v  ==> binary to BCD converter

Test Benches:
- test_shifter.v   ==> for barrel shifter
- test_decoder.v   ==> for binary to BCD converter
